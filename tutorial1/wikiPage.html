            <p>
           The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is native to part of northern Eurasia and NorthAmerica. 
           Its conservation status is currently "Least Concern." There are many subspecies within the brown bear species,
           including the Atlas bear and the Himalayan brown bear.

            Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; they have also been used for bear-baiting 
            and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance. With their powerful physical presence, they play a 
            prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, 
            bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, 
            including the Asian bile bear market. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, 
            and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain countries.
